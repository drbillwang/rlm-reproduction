**Step 1 – Assign labels to each question:**

1. What is one of the languages of the Sioux?  
   → Language name (e.g., Lakota, Dakota) → **entity** (specific named thing, not a person/location/number/abbreviation/description).

2. What is the name of the Family Circus's dog?  
   → Name of a character (e.g., Barfy) → **entity**.

3. What was the verdict in the 1925 trial of John T. Scopes?  
   → ""Guilty"" or ""convicted"" → **description and abstract concept** (verdict is a concept/description).

4. What does snafu stand for?  
   → Expansion of acronym → **abbreviation**.

5. How many colors are there in a rainbow?  
   → Number (e.g., 7) → **numeric value**.

6. Where did the saying ""rule of thumb"" come from?  
   → Origin (e.g., ""from carpentry"" or ""from English common law"") → **description and abstract concept**.

7. Who was the author of the famous fairy tale ""Snow White and Seven Dwarfs""?  
   → Person (e.g., Brothers Grimm) → **human being**.

8. When reading classified ads, what does EENTY : other stand for?  
   → Expansion of abbreviation → **abbreviation**.

9. What is RAM in the computer?  
   → Explanation (e.g., Random Access Memory) → **abbreviation**.

10. What does NAFTA stand for?  
    → Expansion of acronym → **abbreviation**.

11. What film marked Robert Redford's directorial debut?  
    → Film title (e.g., Ordinary People) → **entity**.

12. Which Rockefeller was sometimes called ""JDR3""?  
    → Person (John D. Rockefeller III) → **human being**.

13. In My Antonia, how is Mr. Shimerda out of place on the farm?  
    → Descriptive reason (e.g., he was a city person, or he was depressed) → **description and abstract concept**.

14. What is the regular price?  
    → This is ambiguous without context, but likely asks for a price amount → **numeric value** (or possibly description if it's like ""the standard price""). Given typical quiz context, probably numeric.

**Step 2 – Tally labels:**

- abbreviation: Q4, Q8, Q9, Q10 → 4  
- entity: Q1, Q2, Q11 → 3  
- human being: Q7, Q12 → 2  
- numeric value: Q5, Q14 → 2  
- location: 0  
- description and abstract concept: Q3, Q6, Q13 → 3  

**Step 3 – Compare 'entity' and 'description and abstract concept':**  
Both have count 3 → same frequency.

**Step 4 – Format answer:**
