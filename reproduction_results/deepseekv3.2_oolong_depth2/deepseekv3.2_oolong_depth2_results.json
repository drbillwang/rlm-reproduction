What is one of the languages of the Sioux?  \n   \u2192 Language name (e.g., Lakota, Dakota) \u2192 **entity** (specific named thing, not a person/location/number/abbreviation/description).\n\n2. What is the name of the Family Circus's dog?  \n   \u2192 Name of a character (e.g., Barfy) \u2192 **entity**.\n\n3. What was the verdict in the 1925 trial of John T. Scopes?  \n   \u2192 \"Guilty\" or \"convicted\" \u2192 **description and abstract concept** (verdict is a concept/description).\n\n4. What does snafu stand for?  \n   \u2192 Expansion of acronym \u2192 **abbreviation**.\n\n5. How many colors are there in a rainbow?  \n   \u2192 Number (e.g., 7) \u2192 **numeric value**.\n\n6. Where did the saying \"rule of thumb\" come from?  \n   \u2192 Origin (e.g., \"from carpentry\" or \"from English common law\") \u2192 **description and abstract concept**.\n\n7. Who was the author of the famous fairy tale \"Snow White and Seven Dwarfs\"?  \n   \u2192 Person (e.g., Brothers Grimm) \u2192 **human being**.\n\n8. When reading classified ads, what does EENTY : other stand for?  \n   \u2192 Expansion of abbreviation \u2192 **abbreviation**.\n\n9. What is RAM in the computer?  \n   \u2192 Explanation (e.g., Random Access Memory) \u2192 **abbreviation**.\n\n10. What does NAFTA stand for?  \n    \u2192 Expansion of acronym \u2192 **abbreviation**.\n\n11. What film marked Robert Redford's directorial debut?  \n    \u2192 Film title (e.g., Ordinary People) \u2192 **entity**.\n\n12. Which Rockefeller was sometimes called \"JDR3\"?  \n    \u2192 Person (John D. Rockefeller III) \u2192 **human being**.\n\n13. In My Antonia, how is Mr. Shimerda out of place on the farm?  \n    \u2192 Descriptive reason (e.g., he was a city person, or he was depressed) \u2192 **description and abstract concept**.\n\n14. What is the regular price?  \n    \u2192 This is ambiguous without context, but likely asks for a price amount \u2192 **numeric value** (or possibly description if it's like \"the standard price\"). Given typical quiz context, probably numeric.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Tally labels:**\n\n- abbreviation: Q4, Q8, Q9, Q10 \u2192 4  \n- entity: Q1, Q2, Q11 \u2192 3  \n- human being: Q7, Q12 \u2192 2  \n- numeric value: Q5, Q14 \u2192 2  \n- location: 0  \n- description and abstract concept: Q3, Q6, Q13 \u2192 3  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Compare 'entity' and 'description and abstract concept':**  \nBoth have count 3 \u2192 same frequency.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Format answer:**\n\nAnswer: entity is same frequency as description and abstract concept",
