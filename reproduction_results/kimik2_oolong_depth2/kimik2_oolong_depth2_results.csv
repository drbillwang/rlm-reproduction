The questions whose answers would be classified as 'entity' are:

1. **What is one of the languages of the Sioux?** - Answer would be a language name (e.g., ""Lakota""), which is a distinct entity
2. **What is the name of the Family Circus's dog?** - Answer would be a specific name (e.g., ""Barfy""), which is a character entity
3. **What film marked Robert Redford's directorial debut?** - Answer would be a film title (e.g., ""Ordinary People""), which is a distinct creative work entity

All other questions fall into the remaining categories: 'abbreviation' (5 questions), 'human being' (2 questions), 'numeric value' (2 questions), and 'description and abstract concept' (2 questions).
